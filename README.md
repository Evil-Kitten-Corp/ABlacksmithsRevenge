## Overview
**A Blacksmith's Revenge** is a **first-person VR tower defense game** made in **Unity 6** as a two-week prototype for our **Expanded Realities class**. The game is heavily inspired by *Plants vs. Zombies*, but with a comedic twist: instead of zombies, you defend your home from annoying adventurers who won’t stop looting your house.

You play as a **blacksmith** (more specifically, a NPC in a RPG-type world) who is fed up with adventurers breaking into your home and stealing your stuff. To stop them, you strategically place defenses, switch between first-person and a top-down vigilance camera, and use tools like a **hammer** for repairs, a **shovel** for removing defenses, and a **bow** for direct combat.


## Features
- **First-Person Tower Defense in VR** – Place defenses on a grid to stop waves of adventurers to reach your home.
- **Top-Down Vigilance Camera** – Switch to a top-down view for better strategy and defense placement.
- **Defensive Tools:**
  - **Hammer** – Repair defenses when they're damaged.
  - **Shovel** – Remove defenses if you need to reposition them.
  - **Bow** – Shoot adventurers that make it past your defenses.
- **Three Waves** – The game consists of three escalating waves of enemy adventurers.
